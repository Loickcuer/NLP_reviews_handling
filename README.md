## 📊 Project Overview
This NLP project focuses on analyzing and processing reviews from Trustpilot. It includes data scraping, cleaning, summarization, translation, and predictive modeling. Developed by Nicolas BERLIOZ and Loick CUER as part of the ESILV NLP course.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
Scrape reviews from Trustpilot
Clean and preprocess the collected data
Develop models for review summarization and sentiment prediction
Create interactive Streamlit applications for prediction and summarization

##🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning modeling
Streamlit: Interactive web applications
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text processing and analysis
